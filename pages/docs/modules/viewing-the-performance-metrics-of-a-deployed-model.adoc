= Viewing the performance metrics of a deployed model

[role='_abstract']
To ensure that your deployed model is functioning correctly, you can monitor the model's performance metrics. The following metrics are tracked in OpenShift Data Science:

* Requests per day (x100)
* Average response time (ms)
* CPU utilization (%)
* Memory utilization (%)

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to Red Hat OpenShift Data Science.
* If you are using specialized OpenShift Data Science groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, `rhods-users`) in OpenShift.
* There are deployed data science models available on the *Model Serving* page.

.Procedure
. From the OpenShift Data Science dashboard, click *Model Serving*.
+
The *Model Serving* page opens.
. Click the model whose performance metrics you want to view.
+
The *Metrics* page opens.

.Verification
* The *Metrics* page displays the performance metrics for the relevant model.
