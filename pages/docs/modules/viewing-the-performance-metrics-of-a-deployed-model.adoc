* There are deployed data science models available on the *Model Serving* page.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Model Serving*.
+
The *Model Serving* page opens.
. Click the model whose performance metrics you want to view.
+
The *Metrics* page opens.

.Verification
* The *Metrics* page displays the performance metrics for the relevant model.
